Banda Aceh was a place that was heavily damaged by the tsunami caused by the 2004 Sumatra earthquake. I had a local coordinator accompany me and went to a local elementary school to teach. In addition, we visited the house that was swept away by the tsunami and the tsunami museum, and the coordinator talked about the time in 2004. Also, in the area where Banda Aceh we visited is based on the idea of ​​religion, there is an idea that \"natural disasters are caused by God\", and even now, more than 15 years after 2004, the rubble of that time is still falling on the side of the road. Was seen. Because of this way of thinking, I think there was little interest in knowledge and countermeasures against natural disasters. However, when we visited Banda Aceh last year, there seems to be a gradual increase in awareness of the local tsunami, such as a shelter on a hill and a tsunami museum that records and displays the damage caused by the 2004 tsunami. It was seen.<\/p><p>In order to raise awareness of disaster prevention for children who have not yet experienced the tsunami, we go to elementary schools to teach disaster prevention.

When you hear the word liquefaction, you may think that the water as shown in the picture below is overflowing from the ground or the building is unstable. I think that there are many people who have an image of what kind of phenomenon liquefaction is, but do not understand when it comes to explaining the principle.<\/p><img src = \"\/img\/events\/D-02\/液状化現象.jpg\" alt = \"液状化現象.jpg\"><p>Now, I will explain the cause of this happening. First of all, the major cause is that the pressure of air and water in the ground increases due to strong shaking caused by earthquake motion, and the soil particles (solid particles that make up the soil) in the ground are separated from each other, creating a \"gap\". It can be mentioned that it will end up. When the composition of the soil inside the ground changes due to vibration, water with a low specific gravity is discharged to the outside of the ground, causing the building to sink or manholes to float. Therefore, when the ground liquefies, most of the force that has been exerted on the soil particles is lost, and the force that supports the object is mainly buoyancy, that is, objects with large buoyancy float and those with low buoyancy sink The phenomenon of buoyancy occurs.<\/p><p>From the above, it is possible to consider in what areas liquefaction is likely to occur. Areas where liquefaction is likely to occur are areas where soil particles contain more air and water. Specifically, it is a relatively new land such as a landfill or a place where there used to be rivers, swamps, and ponds. I would like you to find out if the area you live in is an area where liquefaction such as these is likely to occur, and if measures are taken, and use it for disaster prevention.","tag":"p"},{"code":"We will conduct a liquefaction experiment on YouTube!","tag":"h3"},{"code":"We will conduct a liquefaction experiment on YouTube so that everyone can learn about the liquefaction phenomenon in an easy-to-understand and fun way.

TR (Tri-Robot) will use the same undercarriage as the MR1 aircraft of NHK Robocon 2019 held last year, and PR will use the same undercarriage as their Kanto Spring Robocon aircraft, so the design team developed the aircraft.

In addition, the name of the boat race, \"Regatta,\" which was held at a festival in Venice around the 13th century, is still used today. By the way, the Waseda-Keio Regatta, which is held every year in Sumida River and in which the Waseda University Science and Engineering Rowing Club also participates, is called the world's three major regatta along with \"Oxford University VS Cambridge University\" in the United Kingdom and \"Harvard University VS Yale University\" in the United States. I will.<br>In modern times, boat races are said to have increased in popularity due to boat races that were held as part of gambling in England around the 19th century. It has been adopted at the Olympic Games since the 2nd Paris Games in 1900 (women have been adopted since the 1976 Montreal Games).","tag":"p"},{"code":"Introducing the types and charms of ships and their roles by position!","tag":"h3"},{"code":"　There are different types of rowing, such as a one-seater single scull and a two-seater double scull! Here, we will talk about the types of boats owned by the Faculty of Science and Engineering, the attractiveness of those boats, and their roles by position!<br>Before that, I will tell you the names of each boat so that you can understand the explanation from now on smoothly.<br><\/p><img src = \"\/img\/events\/D-13\/ポジション.jpg\" alt = \"ポジション.jpg\"><p>Now let's talk about positions and their roles!<br>In a boat, the seat on the bow side is called bow, and the seat on the stern side is called stroke or pacing. For the other seats, the bow is number 1, followed by number 2 and 3 from the bow side. In addition, large boats such as quads, fores, and eights have a position called cox to steer and give instructions.<br>First of all, in any boat type, it is basic that other players match the movement of the stroke. For this reason, strokes are required to continue rowing with a stable rhythm. On boats without cox, the stroke also acts as the boat's decision-making body.For seats other than the stroke, row hard while adjusting to the movement of the stroke. Seats close to the stroke, No. 3 in the fore and quad, and Nos. 7 and 6 in the eight are required to convey the movement of the stroke to the rear crew as accurately as possible. This is because it is difficult for the player on the bow side seat to directly see the movement of the stroke, and the movement of the stroke can only be known by looking at the movement of the player on the middle seat.<br>Next, I will explain about Cox.The role of Cox is to steer, give instructions, and speak out. Cox steers for the boat to run on the fastest line. Normally, boat races are straight, so Cox tries to keep the boat running straight, but in curved races like the Waseda-Keio regatta, cox steering has a big impact on the race. Also, the instructions from Cox and the voices are very much appreciated as a rower. For example, from information such as the current speed of the boat, the tempo (rate) of rowing, and how much difference it is from the competing boat, a voice to keep the rower's morale, points to be aware of while rowing Instructions, etc., are quite different with and without them. It is also interesting because there are characteristics in how to call out and how to add knots depending on the cox.<br>Next is the introduction of boat types and their attractions!・ Single scull<br>As the name implies, a single scull is a boat that can be rowed by one person. It is usually abbreviated as single, and has one oar on each side.<br>Rowing alone is a characteristic and charm of singles.<br>Of course, when you advance a boat by yourself, you have to decide how to advance the boat. All judgments and actions of the situation are at your own risk. Where do you go in the vast lake, or what course do you take within the traffic rules on a busy course? How fast do you have to row to get to your destination by the scheduled time? Thinking about them for yourself also fosters independence, and it's also a lot of fun (maybe I'm the only one writing this).<br>When rowing a single, the relationship between you and the boat becomes more intense compared to other boat types. Of course, physical strength is important for advancing the boat, but it is also important to efficiently transmit power and convert it into propulsion. In the case of a crew boat rowing with multiple people, it is important to match the timing with the crew, but in a single, the one-to-one relationship between the boat and the person becomes important. The single scull is very comfortable when you change the way you row, the behavior of the boat changes, and when you row well, the boat advances.<br>Also, the single scull has a very small turn compared to other boats, so it is very comfortable to turn around.・ Double scull: Two people use four oars to row. I think the appeal of the double scull is that the two are working together to advance the boat. You might think that the same is true for quads and eights, which I will explain later, but since there are only two double sculls, you can tell immediately if your partner loses even a little power. The reverse is also true. So, even when I think I can't move anymore during the race or practice, my partner is doing their best in the same pain! I can still do my best! We can grow together while working hard together.・ Quadruple (without steering wheel \/ with steering wheel) 4 people use 8 oars to row. There are two types of quadruple, one without a cox and one with a cox. In Quadruple without a steering wheel, a stroke rower or a bow rower moves a stretcher with shoes to steer. Quadruple is said to be the flower shape of girls, and it is a boat type that can feel the fastest speed for girls who can not easily put out eight. It's difficult for four people to match their movements, but when they are in good breath, the boat moves forward and it feels very good.・ Fore<br>Fore is a sweep event where one rower has one oar. It can be divided into a fore with a steering wheel with Cox and a fore without a steering wheel without a cox. The science and engineering rowing department owns a fore with a steering wheel.<br>It is the same as other boat types that the rower behind you matches the rowing of the stroke. In the sweep event, one rower is in charge of either the left or right, but it is important that the height of the oars is the same on the left and right of the boat. It is the fore that the deviation of one person's movement resonates unexpectedly.・ Eight<br>Eight is also a sweep event like the fore. This is only with a steering wheel.<br>Eight's charm is that it has a large number of 8 rowers and Cox, totaling 9 people, and can move a large boat with a total length of about 17 m. It is the fastest boat of all boat types and is also a men's flower-shaped event.<br>It wasn't until the eight people's consciousness and movements were aligned that they were all together! !! I feel that. There are eight people, so it's hard to get them all together, but when they get together, I'm very impressed. When you have them, you will be very fast. Also, it feels like the crew is talking to each other and the team is moving the ship. Even if there are nine people, the bow side and the stern side cannot directly hear the voice, so the middle numbers 4 and 5 may act as relays.","tag":"p"},{"tag":"pagination"},{"code":"What is rigging? ??","tag":"h3"},{"code":"　Rigging plays an important role in rowing!

In addition to that, I have a deep connection with senior graduate students and alumni, and I am very much indebted to them in terms of guidance and competitions. From the name of the science and engineering rowing club, you may have the impression that there are not many liberal arts students enrolled, but now there are many liberal arts students enrolled and students from other schools are also enrolled. One of the attractions of the science and engineering rowing club is that people with different experiences and values ​​can enhance each other while incorporating each other's opinions.<br>1. Percentage of men and women<br>Of the 28 members from the 2nd to 4th grades of the university who belong to the science and engineering rowing club, 17 are male members and 11 are female members. In particular, half of the third graders are women, and the number of female members is increasing year by year. In addition, as will be described later, the science and engineering rowing club has affiliations such as \"rower\", \"muscle training member\", and \"manager\". Most of the male members are rowers, but half of the female members are rowers and managers.<\/p><img src = \"\/img\/events\/D-13\/男女の割合.jpg\" alt = \"男女の割合.jpg\"><p>2. Percentage of humanities and sciences<br>28 undergraduate students and 10 Chinese students are enrolled. Again, the proportion of liberal arts students is increasing year by year, and half of the third grade students are liberal arts students. There are also several members from other schools, and some of them are currently attending from Japan Women's University, Gakushuin Women's University, and even Science University. Basically, all members are free to practice according to their own schedule.<br><\/p><img src = \"\/img\/events\/D-13\/文理の割合.jpg\" alt = \"文理の割合.jpg\"><p>3. Experience in boating<br>Members who have no boating experience account for about 70% of the total. Most members start boating with no experience in boating, but in recent years many members have achieved results at competitions. Both beginners and experienced people are welcome in the science and engineering rowing club.<br><\/p><img src = \"\/img\/events\/D-13\/ボート経験の有無.jpg\" alt = \"ボート経験の有無.jpg\"><p>4. Affiliation form<br>As I mentioned earlier, there are currently three affiliations in the science and engineering rowing club. They are \"rowers\" who actually practice on a boat, \"muscle training members\" who do not row but exercise using the equipment of the science and engineering rowing club, and \"managers\" who mainly support the members. The percentage of undergraduate students currently affiliated is 64% for rowers and 18% for muscle training staff and managers. Members belonging to any affiliation form are indispensable not only to boats but also to the science and engineering rowing club that holds various other events. As a matter of course, individual schedules are respected for practice, support, and participation in events, and there is no superiority or inferiority depending on the affiliation.<br><\/p><img src = \"\/img\/events\/D-13\/所属形態.jpg\" alt = \"所属形態.jpg\"><p>","tag":"p"},{"tag":"pagination"},{"code":"\nMember introduction-4th grade edition-","tag":"h3"},{"code":"We will introduce the members here!

That is the main content of synthetic biology.<br>The physical meaning of synthetic biology is `` What we cannot create, I do not understand it  -R.Feynman “What you cannot make is not truly understood”.

To do that, we first need to model the phenomenon. Modeling is a simplification of the phenomena that occur under various conditions. A better model has a wider range of application and can be combined with other models to show the same behavior even when the initial conditions and parameters are changed. What is important in synthetic biology is Wet, which corresponds to the part where cells are actually handled and biological experiments are performed, and Dry, which corresponds to the part where a theoretical model is constructed using a computer and simulation is performed. It's a repeat, and by doing these you can make a better model. It is not just a matter of conducting experiments with Wet alone, but some past studies have succeeded in creating organisms that did not exist biologically from dry research. It is expected that cells created by synthetic biology will become the mainstream in genetic engineering in the future.In other words, it is important to organize the sequences obtained from various DNAs on a computer, copy and paste them, design a new sequence, and create a program to control the gene to be expressed. Synthetic biology is now a field that is drawing worldwide attention, and the amount of investment in DNA synthesis and drug discovery by synthetic biology in the United States is increasing dramatically year by year, totaling about 400 billion yen in 2018.

The reason for this difference is that the components of the film on the surface are different. The membrane of a real Ikura is made of protein. Protein hardens white when heated, so real Ikura becomes white and cloudy when hot water is poured. This is the same as the white of a transparent raw egg becomes white when it is boiled egg or fried egg. On the other hand, the membrane of artificial ikura is mainly made of alginic acid. Alginic acid does not change color even when heated, so artificial Ikura does not change color even if hot water is poured.<br>　To bring the taste closer to the real thing, the food artificial ikura contains a variety of ingredients besides alginic acid, but in the experiment, artificial ikura can be made from only two reagents. The reagents used are sodium alginate and calcium chloride.<br><\/p><img src = \"\/img\/events\/E-02\/1_人工イクラ.jpg\" alt = \"1_人工イクラ.jpg\"><p>　<\/p><img src = \"\/img\/events\/E-02\/2_人工イクラ.JPG\" alt = \"2_人工イクラ.JPG\"><p>","tag":"p"},{"code":"How do you make artificial Ikura?","tag":"h3"},{"code":"　Artificial Ikura can be created by dripping sodium alginate solution into calcium chloride solution. Sodium alginate is contained in seaweed and becomes a muddy liquid when dissolved in water. Calcium chloride is contained in seawater and is used in dehumidifiers and snow melting agents.

The drooping sodium alginate solution hardens from the surface the moment it touches the calcium chloride solution, resulting in a film of calcium alginate on the surface and the shape of an ikura.

Calcium chloride is a product of chloride ions with a negative charge and calcium ions with a positive charge. Both sodium alginate and calcium chloride dissolve in water. However, calcium alginate, which can be mixed with these two aqueous solutions, does not dissolve in water. Calcium alginate can be by replacing sodium ions attached to alginate ions with calcium ions. Since calcium ions stick together with two alginate ions, multiple alginate ions are joined together to make them larger and less soluble in water. Calcium alginate formed in this way becomes a membrane of artificial ikura. The inside of the membrane is filled with an aqueous solution of sodium alginate that is not solid, so crushing the artificial ikura will result in a muddy liquid.<br><\/p><img src = \"\/img\/events\/E-02\/5_人工イクラ.jpg\" alt = \"5_人工イクラ.jpg\"><p>　<\/p><img src = \"\/img\/events\/E-02\/6_人工イクラ.jpg\" alt = \"6_人工イクラ.jpg\"><p>","tag":"p"},{"code":"Can you carry water with you?","tag":"h3"},{"code":"　One of the things that used the same mechanism as the artificial Ikura is the water that can be carried. The water that can be carried was developed by three students attending the Graduate School of Fine Arts in London with the aim of reducing plastic bottles. Calcium lactate is used instead of calcium chloride when making portable water, but it is the same as artificial Ikura when it comes to the membrane of calcium alginate. In the experiment, we also created water that can be carried in addition to artificial Ikura. Because calcium chloride was used instead of calcium lactate this time, the water that can be carried can be thought of as a large artificial Ikura.<br>　The water that can be carried can be created by pouring sodium alginate solution into a ball and slowly soaking it in calcium chloride solution. Here, if the time to soak is short, the film will become thinner, so it will be easy to break. In addition, if you do not soak it well, it will not become a beautiful round shape.

(Excerpts from the department's website). Since it was established in 2007, I think it can be seen that it is a very new department in the Faculty of Advanced Science and Engineering. Even if it is called \"life medicine science\", it may not come to the pin, but it may be easy to understand if the high school student thinks that it is an extension of the class of the living thing which is being taught in the high school. Students will learn more about life phenomena such as gene transcription and translation, such as those learned in high school.<br>The Department of Biomedic arts and Sciences has 10 full-time professors. Although the research field varies from professor to professor, there are many themes that are familiar to us in connection with medicine, such as regenerative medicine, intestinal bacteria, and lifestyle-related diseases. In addition, if you look at the degrees of the professors, you can see that there are various research topics from the breakdown of three Doctors of Science, four Doctors of Engineering, and three Doctors of Medicine. For example, if you have a laboratory (Takeda Lab) that is working on the development of technologies that can control cells with the aim of realizing regenerative medicine, there are laboratories (Tokida Lab.) that analyze microorganisms to elucidate the mechanisms of specific diseases, and laboratories (Oshima Lab.) that work on elucidating the movement of brain nerves during the development process. For more information, please refer to the department's website for detailed faculty members and research introductions.<br>In the Department of Biomedic arts and Sciences, students take classes and experiments during the first and third year of undergraduate studies, aiming to accumulate knowledge necessary for research and improve experimental skills. At the end of the third year, students will be assigned to their respective laboratories in earnest and begin their research activities. Even if I say, \"I play a central role in the education and research of biomedic science,\" I have not been teaching biology for a long time. Especially in the first year, there are many classes such as mathematics and chemistry that are the basis, and the number of biology classes increases with each grade. We're also explaining it in detail in the video, so please take a look. In addition, the Department of Biomedic arts and Sciences can apply for both physics and chemistry selection and biological and chemical selection, but in the first grade classes, classes may be divided according to the choice. One of the features is that the curriculum has been developed so that students can change the courses they take according to their choice of subjects at the time of the entrance examination, and that any choice will be understood equally.After graduating from undergraduate school, approximately 90% of students go on to graduate school (master's course), and after completing the master's course, about 70% of them find employment.

However, I don't stay in a laboratory or university from within an undergraduate student, and I don't experiment all day.

It's true that I'm a science student, but I think you can see that I don't take classes all day long in the morning. About the bedtime (Q2), I think that it affects the return of the part-time job from the time of going to school (Q4) and the end of school (Q6). Some of them digest the problems they've accumulated at night. (Laughs, like Mr. A).) So what about life while you're at school? I believe that I take classes seriously, and I often spend my time talking with my friends during my break. While talking with friends, you can often see the scenery such as assignments and snacks on the science and engineering campus. By the way, when I asked Mr. A himself, he said that he ate sweets during his break and didn't have any problems at all (sweat).<br>　Finally, Q7's online classes have changed people's lives, but I hope that many university students who have introduced online classes, as well as the Department of Biomedicology, felt.","tag":"p"},{"tag":"pagination"},{"code":"Life Science Experiments Using Things Around Us?","tag":"h2"},{"code":"Feel the power of enzymes","tag":"h3"},{"code":"　Many people have heard of the word enzyme, such as \"enzyme diet\" becoming a hot topic in the bag.

On the other hand, behind the tires, air is flowing into the space that appears when the tires separate.

At that time, the motor protein that works using energy is working, but when I learned that it works in nerve cells, I started researching nerve cells. Then, I learned that even if nerve cells do not have proteins that move using energy such as motor proteins, there are places where things gather where they should. It's called a synapse, but if the creatures really only obey the laws of physics, it's very strange to get together. In reality, the law of the universe advances toward the direction of being scattered and uniform, but the creatures are against it, and they are against it with very little energy. Ever since I realized that it is the nerve cells in the brain that are causing such a mysterious thing, I have been studying the mechanism of nerve cells ever since.","tag":"p"},{"code":"Do you really want to study and don't want to take classes?","tag":"h3"},{"code":"I don't know.

What you can do alone is really limited, and no matter how hard you try, you cannot cover all the achievements that you will do in the future, so using effort firmly in education is very cost effective for research.

I think that even if I go to university or society from now on, I will be able to say words such as putting a lid on my limits or making me feel the limits such as \"I can not do that\". However, it feels like it's being cursed. Also, it's really a curse for girls to say, \"Because I'm a mother,\" so it's okay to keep ignoring it when told, but if you have a word in yourself that will blow it away, it's about to come. I think it's good to live, and I say \"If you don't like it, you should stop\", but I think it's good to be able to properly say back to yourself who will get it. ..

I haven't always lived my life efficiently, but I have no regrets. I think it's best to move on to what you wanted to do the most at that time. It's possible to throw everything else, but maybe I can't give 100% strength, but I think it's necessary to move forward even with 70%, so something. When there are three things I have to do, I think it's a good idea to acquire the skills to do other things efficiently so that you can do other things while securing the time for what you want to do the most. I will. To be specific, is it still concentrated? If you decide to do it, I think you should do it. In fact, the reason why I don't move forward is that the feeling of \"I don't like it, I don't want to do this\" wastes time and energy in me. That's why it's important to control the feeling that you don't like it, open it up again, do it even if it's 70%, and don't write a report up to A4 full, so it's important to submit it anyway. I think it is important to select the sides. If you try it unexpectedly, it may be filled with A4 or something (laughs). Even if the teachers say one A4 sheet, I don't look at the number of letters, I think it's the content. That's why I appreciate reports that are concise and focused.","tag":"p"},{"code":"What is the solution when two conflicting opinions arise?","tag":"h3"},{"code":"It's a good question. I don't have an answer myself, but I think it's a dialogue. I think that dialogue is to find out what to do by listening to the reason \"why did this happen\" because you cannot understand \"why do you think so\" just by listening to the surface of the opinion. Therefore, the optimal solution to this question may be one of them, but I think it would be better to come up with a new idea that is neither of the two. The more conflicting you are, the more happy you are when the third idea comes up.","tag":"p"},{"code":"What do you think will be important in your future life?","tag":"h3"},{"code":"I think it's a connection with people. There is a limit to what I can do on my own, and although I can demonstrate my abilities in what I like, it is very difficult to study by myself to the extent that it is not. Therefore, I think it is necessary to have the ability to find friends who can do such things, and to cooperate and connect what they are good at by making the best use of their individuality. Rather than having a very good ability, I'm the type of person who thinks that the person over there is good at that and this person is good at this, so it would be nice to connect. I think that in the future, we will need the idea and ability to do things that one person cannot do by connecting people in that way.

I thought it would be unreasonable to teach them all together, but everyone can follow me. So, everyone has a very wide field of view, and I have never taught from such a wide field of view, so that is what makes Waseda's lessons interesting.

Some people can come to ask questions after class, but I don't think everyone can come, so by using Waseda Moodle this time, after watching the video, they will send me an email or write with a task teacher. I think I received more messages from students than ever before in various ways. So, from the teacher's point of view, I think online was good.

It's okay to enroll, but I want to go home after college holidays. Surprisingly, however, at that time you laid the foundations for all the important discoveries such as the law of universal gravitation and calculus. With that in mind, at first I thought, \"I can't do anything with this kind of closure,\" but I thought that there were ways to use my time and my mind, and in your case, I made such a big discovery.

There are time when you have to decide something, don't you? For example, political policy decisions are also made, and in the Department of Management Systems Engineering, there are decisions such as how much to make and where to make things. More familiar, he said, \"Oh, tomorrow is my first face-to-face class in a long time. I think there is also a decision on what kind of clothes to wear.\" When you decide something like that, there's a kind of standard for people, isn't there? For example, when it comes to traveling, I think there are criteria for each satisfaction level, such as how happy you are if you can eat delicious rice, or if you can see beautiful scenery. On the other hand, I think there are various restrictions. For example, this time you can only spend about 50,000 yen, or if it's crowded, you don't want to. Let's make a decision that maximizes satisfaction in such constraints mathematically using equations or cal products.<br>If you replace the problem with various things, you can do anything, so I hope you think of it as a \"anything shop\"...

For example, when we apply environmental issues, if we improve the environment, people all over the world will be happy more and more.

Since the Department of Management Systems Engineering is assigned for three years, there are absolutely 20 students, especially in the second semester, and when a master's degree comes in, there are 30 people and 40 students. It's amazing, about one class in elementary school. The number of teachers is seen by one teacher. When I was an assistant professor at Osaka University, the basic laboratory was a three-person system. There are three professors, an associate professor, and an assistant professor, and these three students are about 10 to 15 students. There is a difference there, too. So, of course, I do my own research, but I think that the major part of pushing students to do their best is the research style of private universities, including Waseda.","tag":"p"},{"code":"Does the professor get stuck in his research and get cornered?","tag":"h3"},{"code":"I often get stuck in my research. In other words, basically, I think research is a jam. How much you can break down that wall leads to the results of your research. Therefore, I think that research that does not get stuck is, of course, research is research, but I think that it becomes a story that it is possible to do even if it is not a university. If you talk about extremes, can companies and individuals do it?<br>The research I do at university is definitely that I don't have an answer because it's a research that I don't know if I can use it now or not, but it's a research that I think is necessary. Therefore, it is a professor at all to get stuck. So it's also important to have a perspective on how to break through it. You can discussing a lot of things, you can think silently alone on the train, you can think while taking a bath, you can think while absent-mindedly outside, that is, anything is fine. Anyway, it's always time to get stuck. Please write that I'm stuck now too (laughs)","tag":"p"},{"code":"What do you want to wear while you are an undergraduate student?","tag":"h3"},{"code":"I think the most important thing I want undergraduate students to learn is communication skills, including language skills. I said a little while ago that I'm going to think silently by myself, but I think things that can be done by one person, including research, will be quite limited in the future, so I think it will be important to do something with someone. At that time, if you can't communicate, you won't be able to do anything, so I'm wondering if you'll be able to improve your communication skills regardless of media. In the course of developing communication skills, if you do things overseas, you will need language skills, and if you are going to work with great people, I think that writing e-mail skills and manners will become important.

I studied physics and chemistry mainly in study supplements. Physics solved the forest of other famous questions, and then moved on to the past questions of March, Hayakei, and the former Imperial University. Chemistry was able to compete well only with the study supplement and the past question exercise. I hardened my vocabulary with Siss single, iron wall, and dismantling English idioms, studied grammar in study supplements, and worked on it in Manavis's English reading class.

This time, we conducted experiments with flours other than potato starch, but there were some objects that did not cause dilatancy. Why. This is due to the arrangement of the particles explained earlier, and it did not form a close-packed form.

When the number of Mentos is larger than a certain number, the height at which the cola pops out becomes constant.<\/p><p>I found out that.","tag":"p"},{"code":"I considered it.","tag":"h3"},{"code":"So why did the expectations and results disagree? Let's think about it one by one.<br>First of all, regarding (1), there was a problem with how we measure the strength of carbonic acid.<br>1. Since the scale used was in units of 1g, accurate values ​​could not be obtained.<br>2. Since it was a visual measurement whether or not the carbonic acid was completely removed, the carbonic acid was not completely removed.<br>For these two reasons, the strength of carbonic acid was not accurately determined, and it is possible that the results did not match the expectations. If we could increase the number of carbonated drinks and increase the experimental data, I think we could have obtained more accurate results by taking the average value. Everyone, let's do it at home.Regarding (2), the cause of this is that the range of the network formed by the water molecules disturbed by one Mentos is large, and in the case of this experiment, the network of water molecules covering the carbon dioxide contained in Coca-Cola 500ML It is thought that the amount of cola that pops out (= the amount of increased carbon dioxide) does not change even if more Mentos are added because it is completely disturbed by two Mentos.","tag":"p"},{"code":"finally","tag":"h3"},{"code":"So far, we have explained and experimented with Mentos Coke, but how was everyone? For me, I would like to add Frisk in addition to Mentos to Coke (I'm just vaguely thinking that it might react). Various experiments are likely to proceed. This time, the result was not as good as I had expected, so elementary school students are encouraged to publish a video that shows a large amount of Mentos and carbonic acid in next year's independent study.<\/p><p>Then, please enjoy the science and engineering exhibition.

Water molecules (H2O) have a force called \"surface tension\" that pulls each other, so bubbles disappear even if you just touch water, but surfactants weaken the surface tension that acts on water. Because of its function, water does not round and a film with a large surface surface is formed. This is how soap foams!<\/p><p>The figure shows why surfactants remove stains, so let's check!
